<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector could be applied to doing operations with vectors.

It works with the Vertex class. In order to create a vector you need to pass 
the following parameters:
(mandatory) 'dest' - the vector’s destination vertex,
(optional) 'orig' - the vector’s origin vertex.
If 'orig doesn't exist, its default value is vertex with (x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1).

Vecotor class methods are as follows:
*	float magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm").
*	Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the
vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.
*	Vector add(Vector $rhs) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.
*	Vector sub(Vector $rhs) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.
*	Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.
*	Vector scalarProduct($k) : returns the multiplication of the vector
with a scalar.
*	float dotProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the scalar multiplication
of both vectors.
*	float cos(Vector $rhs) : returns the angle’s cosine between both vec- tors.
*	Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the cross multiplication
of both vectors (right-hand mark)
