# PHP Piscine
 77/100 edits in progress

List of fixes to be done:

Day 4: create.php overwrites the the existing user in private/passwd; in ex04/create.php a header() redirects you unexpectedly
Day 5: error in ex16
Day 9: cookies don't work for ex02bis

Rush 00: not attempted, I took a nap, I'm a litle sorry but not too much 
Rush 01: https://github.com/pontuslaandersson/php_rush01.git inccomplete, edits in progress ^_^ 

NOTE on Day07: subject specifies use everything learned since Piscine's beginning while eval form asks for specific methods. 
Descrepancy can be hashed out during defence. (Be confident in your code! <3)
